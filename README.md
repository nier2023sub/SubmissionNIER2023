# ASSESSMENT AND IMPROVEMENT CYCLE

This repository is the replication package related to a NEAR 2023 submission.
In this repository, the code to repeat the experiments is available.
We reported the datasets to completely reproduce the experiments on MNIST.

# Requirements
To run the experiments it is required to install python 3 and all the requirements reported in the requirement.txt file.
DNN-OS requires the installation of KNIME (https://www.knime.com/downloads).

# Execution
To execute all the experiments run the command 'sh run_complete.sh'.
All the pre-trained models are available.
The script will stop the execution at each cycle to allow the execution of DNN-OS on KNIME.
To execute DNN-OS it is required to set the path to the desired training, validation and test sets automatically generated by the python script. The operational accuray estimate can be read as output of the last "colum rename" block.

The experiments with SelfChecher can be executed running the code available in the replication package available at https://github.com/self-checker/SelfChecker.
